# NewsMonkey
This is my first React based project.

A Website that uses free opensource APIs to display news. 

This Application is developed using REACT and an open source API for developers.
Developers can find the link to the opensource api below:
https://newsapi.org/

Some features of this Application:
1) Multiple categories available: Sports, Entertainment, Health, etc.
2) Automatically fetched the next set of news when we reach the end of the page while scrolling.
3) Loading bar to simulate the loading effect for better user experience.
4) Website maintained to be responsive for majority of devices.

Step 1: Import the repository and open the repository.

Step 3: Run the following commands:
        1) npm install

Step 4: After the compilation is successful, open your browser and go to the localhost port where the project is running.eg(http://localhost:3000)
